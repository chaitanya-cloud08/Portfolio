    description: "I interned in Product Management at Times Internet, where I worked with the Language Apps team on multiple high-impact projects. My work included the Newspoint UX revamp, NBT Games integration, Activity Bar implementation, and strategies to improve WTA installs. I collaborated closely with design, tech, and growth teams to map user journeys, write UX copy, and plan features. Along the way, I received feedback to slow down and focus more on analysis, which helped me develop a more thoughtful approach to problem-solving. The internship gave me hands-on experience in building user-focused features and understanding how product decisions are made at scale.",
